# Cracking the Coding Interview with Rust

This repository contains code for my YouTube programming interview practice & learning series about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The problems are based on the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. You can find the [existing solutions here](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition).

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you'll need an up-to-date version of Rust. The recommended way of
installing Rust is [using a tool called rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```ShellSession
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
...
```

Once you have Rust installed, you can build and run the tests.

### Running the Code

```ShellSession
$ cargo build
$ cargo test
...
```
